## Delivery App

Home delivery app prototype.

Minimalist delivery app site making the order process much faster and simple.

Using React and Google Firebase.


## Big app Refactor

This app name will be changed for "Delivery App"

The app will get a big refactor on the logic/state. Instead of handle only pizza store templates will handle any type of online delivery store (foods, drinks, cloths, games...).


### Stack (desired)

- React: Interface and state management.
- React-router: Routes for navigation.
- Styled-Components:
- Firebase: Authentication and database.
- Typescript: Code quality and safety.
